Emergency Badges
===============

A basic framework to help people give recognition via OpenBadges during times of emergency.

Workflow:<br>
Check out an interactive workflow here: <em>http://proto.ballard.is/moz/ehl/</em>

<ol>
<li><strong>Organize:</strong> Citizens organize into a help center and create lists of citizen tasks (not being handled by emergency responders) and OpenBadges. Examples of relevent badge descriptions and criteria can be found here. Crowdcrafting could be used as the micro-tasking tool for the community.</li>
<li><strong>Application and Scheduling:</strong> Volunteers are reviewed and sign up for specific tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Perform and Verify Task:</strong>OrgMemberA performs a task which is seen/verified by OrgMemberB. OrgMemberB texts in the ID of the OrgMemberA + location ID + any (optional) evidence. </li>
<li><strong>Badge:</strong> OrgMemberA (the volunteer who has been seen or verified doing something) receives an SMS badge which consits of a claim code plus an option to text back to learn about remaining tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback:</strong> The volunteer who has been seen/verified doing something receives an SMS badge which consits of a claim code plus an option to text back to learn about remaining tasks.
</li>
